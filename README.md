## Why?

I’m Kristian, a DevOps leader, and this document is my Manager README — a guide to my approach and values as a leader. I believe that trust, transparency and shared understanding are foundational to a successful team, so I’ve outlined my philosophies, expectations, and ways of working to help us get there faster.

## Intro

- What is my job? I'm there to help enable my teams (and the teams around me) to do the best work of their lives. I can provide support, remove obstacles, and ensure each person has the resources they need to thrive. I will always prioritize the growth, well-being, and success of my team members.
- Work/life balance: I believe in working to live, not living to work, and I encourage everyone on my team to find a balance that suits them. Everyone has different priorities, and I respect each person’s individual balance between work and personal life.
- Delivery: The responsibility for 'what' teams deliver is decided in conjunction with stakeholders and higher level objectives, but the 'how' should be left for teams to decide.
- Psychological Safety: I am committed to fostering a psychologically safe environment where everyone feels respected, comfortable sharing ideas, and safe to speak up. Mistakes are seen as learning opportunities, and collaboration is encouraged to ensure all voices are heard.
- Being as inclusive as I can to the people in my team and the wider business is very important to me. I will:
  - Look for opportunities to give underrepresented groups the benefit of my experience, my time and hopefully roles on my team. This makes good business sense (hiring diverse voices means that the products you deliver are much more likely to suit them, therefore appealing to a larger % of your market) as well as being the correct human thing to do.
  - Give space in sessions I run to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to give their valued input.
  - Endeavour to use inclusive language and avoid unconscious bias (as well as gently addressing it when I notice others may not).

## Agile Practices

I feel the message central to the vast majority of writing around Agile development practices is:

- Break work up into small increments, leading to shorter feedback loops.
- Deliver regularly.
- Have an outcome in mind, anticipating that implementation details may evolve throughout the development lifecycle.

I've worked in teams who've run framework-aligned Scrum ceremonies, Kanban, Scrumban and a variety of others. I'm keen for teams to choose a methodology that works well for them, but with the following guidelines:

- A spirit of experimentation is maintained, whereby new working practices, ceremonies and techniques can be regularly iterated on to improve team cohesion and delivery.
- Everyone in the team is responsible for and owns the choices made.

## 1:1s:

I will schedule 1:1s regularly with everyone who reports directly to me - usually a 30 minute chat every other week works well, but I'm happy to flex that frequency to what works best for each person.

I like to emphasise that it's _your time_ with me, so you decide what we talk about.
Some suggestions of things we might touch on include:

- Current work you've got going on.
- Any concerns or blockers you have.
- Anything going on with you that you'd like to discuss.
- Any feedback we have for each other (very important that this conversation is 2 way!)
- Pairing on a technical item you'd like a second pair of eyes on.
- Longer-term goal progress (although we will have separate dedicated monthly time book to run through these).
- Any feedback or concerns you have about any of your direct reports.

## Personal Goals

- Most workplaces have a concept of longer-term personal development and performance goals to assist in conversations about your personal development. Even if there are no formal policies, I will always encourage setting and maintaining longer term goals.
- Why do I feel goals are valuable?
  - It's helpful for an organisation to succinctly articulate the value individuals and a team are delivering and well-written goals make this indisputable (especially when it's time for performance reviews).
  - It's likely to be very fulfilling to reflect on the scale and scope of the work you have completed over the course of the year and feel the deserved sense of accomplishment as a result - that you've delivered meaningful, significant work and can see how this work fits into the larger goals of your team and the company as a whole.
- I like the SMART methodology for writing goals, but there are many different mnemonics out there - the important aspects for me are:
  - Goals are 'outcome-based' not "I will deliver technology X into production". The latter doesn't articulate the value in delivering on the initiative (and is also vulnerable to changes outside of an individual's control making it impossible to complete).
  - Realistic - I like 'stretch'-type goals, but if they're too ambitious you'll be disheartened when you realise it's impossible to achieve in the time you've given yourself.
  - Broken-up; I prefer goals that will take around 3 months or less to complete (anything shorter than 1 month probably isn't worth a goal for, or should be combined with another initiative). This is a good rule-of-thumb that ensures that goals will be written in a specific way and that the value is delivered in smaller chunks.
  - Goals are split into:
    - "deliverables for the business which will contribute to our team's objectives" (Performance Goals)
    - "individual achievements that support your future success" (Development Goals)
- I will organise regular sessions where we review the goals set and the milestones achieved against them - goals are easy to relegate to the bottom of your priority list for review and they deserve the attention. They're only as useful as the effort we put in to making them - poorly written, badly maintained goals will not articulate the value of the work delivered and will likely bear little resemblance to what was actually worked on over the course of a year.

## Interviews / Recruitment:

- Try to make interviews more of a conversation than a robotic set of questions read out to individuals.
- Set up a process that adequately tests soft skills as well as the technical skills necessary to be successful in any given role.
- Use take-home exercises with caution, as requiring them can exclude candidates with limited time outside of work.
- Take detailed notes as part of the interview (aim to almost transcribe the responses of the interviewee) to ensure that feedback is accurate and representative of the conversation.
- If a candidate isn’t quite right for the applied role but has potential, consider other opportunities within the business.
- Prioritize hiring for potential over current skills, with exceptions for urgent business needs.
- Pay people what they're worth, don't stiff them on the first offer in the hope they'll accept something less and negotiate.

## Admin:

- If you have problems with your workplace setup, technology or really anything that gets in the way of you delivering the way you'd like, please make sure you let me know. I'll do everything in my power to fix it (a workplace setup that doesn't enable your best work is much more expensive in the long-run than whatever laptop Apple are hawking at the time).
- Let me know if you're not well or you need time off work for any reason. In the case of sickness, I don't need the details, but a rough guess on when you're likely to be back is always helpful. I much prefer team members to take time out if they're sick than struggle into work - don't be a hero!

## Annual Leave

- Expect to receive regular gentle nudges to ensure you are planning ahead to take all your annual leave. I take these matters very seriously, because taking leave is important for your mental and physical wellbeing. Avoiding burn-out is also an important part of maintaining a high performing team which benefits both you and the company.
- Please ensure (outside of unusual family circumstances) you are spreading your annual leave out over the holiday year - those who reach December with nearly a month's leave to take are both putting their well-being at risk and leave the company in the awkward position of having critical staff unavailable for extended periods of time.
- I prefer workplace policies where managers are not given approval rights on annual leave, but instead this is left to team members to negotiate between themselves. Part of the 'how' we deliver work includes managing throughput of the team and clearly annual leave has a big part to play in what we can deliver and when.
